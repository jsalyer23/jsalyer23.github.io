&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I came into the Omaha Code School, I was pretty sure that all I was interested in learning was how to become a back-end developer. I enjoyed working on the code challenges we had at the beginning of class, I like understanding how things work, and I'm not very good with planning out colors/designs.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When HTML and CSS were introduced during the first week of class I struggled to even get close to the design comp that was provided for us. Since then, I seem to have gotten better with following someone else's design. It's very satisfying to make progress on something that initially I thought there was no way I could accomplish.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So now I need to decide which path I would like to dive into more. I feel like I might be becoming more productive while working on front-end projects but I still enjoy figuring out challenges on the back-end side of things. I'm not sure which way to go anymore.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lately I think I have been leaning towards learning more front-end development. Still a little unsure but I think that I can have the opportunity to do both well eventually. I think right now I want to focus on becomeing the best front-end developer I can and work on back-end development in my spare time.
